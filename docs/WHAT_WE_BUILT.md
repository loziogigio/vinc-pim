# VIC Storefront - What We Built

**Project:** VIC Storefront Content Management System
**Timeline:** January 2025 → October 2025 (10 months)
**Status:** 🟢 Ready to Use

---

## 🎯 What Is This?

Think of it as **WordPress for e-commerce stores**, but built specifically for VINC's business. It's a website builder where anyone can create and edit beautiful storefront pages without writing code.

---

## 🖼️ What Can You Do With It?

### 1. Build Pages Visually (No Coding!)

**The Problem We Solved:**
- Before: Needed a developer to change website content (days/weeks)
- After: Anyone can update pages in 15 minutes

**How It Works:**
1. Open the page builder
2. Drag blocks onto the page (like building with LEGO)
3. Click a block to edit text, images, colors
4. See changes live as you work
5. Click "Publish" when ready

**Example:**
> "I want to add a hero banner with our summer sale promotion"
>
> ✅ Drag "Hero Banner" block
> ✅ Upload summer image
> ✅ Type "Summer Sale - 30% Off!"
> ✅ Add "Shop Now" button
> ✅ Publish → Live on website!
>
> **Time:** 5 minutes

---

### 2. Use Pre-Built Building Blocks

Like having a box of professional website pieces ready to use:

#### 🎨 **Hero Sections** (Eye-catching headers)
- **Full-Width Banner** - Big image with text overlay
- **Split Layout** - Text on one side, image on other
- **Grid Layout** - Multiple tiles
- **Carousel** - Rotating images

**What You Can Customize:**
- Background image or color
- Heading text
- Subtitle text
- Button text and link
- Text alignment
- Size (small, medium, large)

#### 🛍️ **Product Sections** (Show your products)

- **Featured Products** - Highlight special items

**What You Can Customize:**

- Number of columns
- Show badges (New, Sale)
- Add to cart button

#### 📂 **Category Sections** (Organize by type)
- **Category Grid** - Cards showing product categories
- **Category Carousel** - Scrolling category cards

**What You Can Customize:**

- Number of columns

---

### 3. Manage Different Versions (Like Save Points in a Game)

**Why This Matters:**
- Test changes before going live
- Keep history of what worked
- Roll back if something breaks
- Copy successful designs

#### **Version Features:**

##### 📝 **Save Drafts**
- Work on changes without affecting live site
- Save as many times as you want
- Come back later to finish

**Example:**
> "I'm updating the homepage but not ready to publish"
> - Make changes
> - Click "Save Draft"
> - Changes saved, but website still shows old version
> - Finish tomorrow, then publish

##### 🚀 **Publish**
- Make changes go live on website
- Creates a permanent version
- Can't accidentally delete published versions

**Example:**
> "My draft looks good, let's make it live"
> - Click "Publish"
> - Website instantly shows new version
> - Old version saved in history

##### 🔥 **Hot Fix** (NEW!)
- Quick fixes on live pages without creating new versions
- Perfect for typos, image swaps, small text changes

**Example:**
> "Oh no! The phone number on the live site has a typo"
> - Open page builder (shows live version)
> - Fix the typo
> - Click "Hot Fix"
> - Change goes live immediately
> - Version number stays the same (no clutter)

**When to use Hot Fix:**
- Fixing typos
- Updating prices
- Swapping images
- Changing button text
- Quick content updates

**When to use regular Save/Publish:**
- Major redesigns
- Adding new sections
- Structural changes

##### 📋 **Version History**
- See all past versions
- Click any version to view it
- Load old version to edit
- Delete draft versions you don't need

**Example:**
> "Last month's homepage worked better, let's go back to that"
> - Open Version History
> - See list: v1, v2, v3, v4, v5 (current)
> - Click "Load" on v3
> - Now editing v3
> - Click "Publish" to make it live again

##### 📑 **Duplicate Version** (NEW!)
- Copy any version as a starting point
- Great for reusing successful designs

**Example:**
> "Version 2 performed well, let's use it as a template for the new sale page"
> - Open Version History
> - Click "Duplicate" on Version 2
> - Creates Version 6 (draft) with same content
> - Edit Version 6 for your needs
> - Publish when ready

**Version Timeline Example:**
```
Version 1 (Jan 2025) - Published ✅
  ↓
Version 2 (Feb 2025) - Published ✅ (Valentine's Sale)
  ↓
Version 3 (Mar 2025) - Draft ⏳ (Testing new layout)
  ↓
Version 4 (Apr 2025) - Published ✅ (Spring Collection)
  ↓
Version 5 (Oct 2025) - Published ✅ (Current)
  ↓
Version 6 (Oct 2025) - Draft ⏳ (Working on Halloween Sale)
```

Each version shows:
- Version number
- Date created
- Status (Published, Draft, Current)
- Number of blocks
- Who created it
